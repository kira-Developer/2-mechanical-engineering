# Task2-mechanical-enginnering

This repository contains two subtastks:

- [Suspension system](https://github.com/farahhrs/Task2-mechanical-engineering#suspension-system)

- [Wheel assembly](https://github.com/farahhrs/Task2-mechanical-engineering#wheel-assembly)

## Suspension system

- In this task I designed a suspension system that consists of [spring mass & suspension](https://github.com/farahhrs/Task2-mechanical-enginnering/blob/main/Suspension%20system/Spring%20mass%20%26%20Suspension.stl) and a [tyre](https://github.com/farahhrs/Task2-mechanical-enginnering/blob/main/Suspension%20system/Tyre.stl), this suggested suspension system will ensure a stable movement of the robot's body with very little vibration.

## Wheel assembly 
- In this task I relied on the given wheel measurements to create a 3D design for the wheel, also I made some modifications on leg7.stl file to make it suitable to add the wheel.
